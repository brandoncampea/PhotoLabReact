## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ and npm
- ASP.NET backend API running (see backend documentation)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
cd /Users/brandoncampea/Projects/PhotoLabReact
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
   - Update `VITE_API_URL` with your ASP.NET backend URL

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

## API Integration

The app expects the following ASP.NET backend endpoints:

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration

### Albums
- `GET /api/albums` - Get all albums
- `GET /api/albums/{id}` - Get album by ID

### Photos
- `GET /api/albums/{albumId}/photos` - Get photos in album
- `GET /api/photos/{id}` - Get photo by ID

### Orders
- `GET /api/orders` - Get user's orders
- `GET /api/orders/{id}` - Get order by ID
- `POST /api/orders` - Create new order

## Authentication Flow

1. User registers or logs in
2. Backend returns JWT token
3. Token stored in localStorage
4. Token sent in Authorization header for all API requests
5. Automatic logout on 401 responses

## State Management

### AuthContext
- Manages user authentication state
- Provides login, register, and logout functions
- Persists user data in localStorage

### CartContext
- Manages shopping cart state
- Handles add, remove, and update operations
- Persists cart data in localStorage
- Calculates totals

## Key Features

### Image Cropping
- Uses react-cropper for intuitive image cropping
- Crop data saved with cart items
- Option to add without cropping

### Protected Routes
- Routes require authentication
- Automatic redirect to login if not authenticated
- Preserves intended destination

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first CSS approach
- Flexible grid layouts
- Touch-friendly controls
- Optimized for all screen sizes

## Browser Support

- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)

## Development Notes

- The app uses TypeScript for type safety
- ESLint configured for code quality
- Vite provides fast hot module replacement
- All components are functional with React Hooks

## Backend API Requirements

Your ASP.NET backend should:
1. Support CORS for the frontend origin
2. Return JWT tokens on successful authentication
3. Accept Bearer tokens in Authorization header
4. Return appropriate error messages and status codes
5. Follow REST conventions

Example response formats are defined in `src/types/index.ts`

## Deployment

1. Build the production bundle:
```bash
npm run build
```

2. The `dist` folder contains the production build
3. Deploy to your hosting service (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
4. Update `VITE_API_URL` environment variable for production

## Troubleshooting

### CORS Issues
- Ensure your ASP.NET backend has CORS properly configured
- Check that the API URL in `.env.local` is correct

### Authentication Issues
- Clear localStorage and try logging in again
- Check browser console for error messages
- Verify backend is returning proper JWT tokens

### Build Errors
- Delete `node_modules` and run `npm install` again
- Clear Vite cache: `rm -rf node_modules/.vite`

4. View results with complete metadata grid

### Search Examples
- **"Canon"** + Camera filter → All Canon photos
